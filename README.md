# Threejs-WebGPU-IFFT-Ocean-V1

This is the first version of my threejs webGPU oceans. There is still a lot to do but also a lot has already been achieved.

The camera can be moved using arrow keys and WASD

For vite I just added a config. So if you want to use vite you still have to install vite. 
The reason I don't have vite installed is because it uses 100MB more.
Anyone who uses Visual Studio Code with the live server can run this code directly after downloading.
